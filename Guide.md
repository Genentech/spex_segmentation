# Guide to Creating Scripts 

## Introduction

This project provides a unique opportunity for users to create their own scripts and plugins, granting additional functionality and flexibility.

Each script you create will be represented by two main files: `manifest.json` and `app.py`. `app.py` contains Python code that performs the task required. `manifest.json` is metadata describing the function, dependencies, and parameters of the script.

## Creating a Script

### `app.py` File

The `app.py` file contains Python code that performs the script's functions. This file should include a `run` function, which takes arguments and returns a dictionary of results.

The input arguments should match the parameters defined in the `manifest.json` file.

Example of `run` function:

```python
    def run(**kwargs):
    # your code here
    return {'result': result}
```
### `manifest.json` File

The `manifest.json` file describes the metadata of the script, including its function, dependencies, parameters, and returned values.

The main fields in the `manifest.json` file include:

- `description`: a brief description of the script's function.
- `name`: a unique name of the script.
- `stage`: grouping of scripts by stages (e.g., preprocessing, processing, post-processing).
- `params`: a dictionary of parameters that can be passed to the script. Each parameter has the following attributes:
  - `name`: the name of the parameter.
  - `description`: a description of the parameter.
  - `type`: the data type of the parameter.
  - `hidden`: if `true`, the parameter is hidden from the user.
  - `default`: the default value for the parameter.
  - `required`: if `true`, the parameter is mandatory.
- `script_path`: the relative path to the script directory.
- `return`: a dictionary of values returned by the script.
- `depends_and_script`: a list of scripts that must be executed before this script.
- `depends_or_script`: a list of scripts, one of which must be executed before this script.
- `libs`: a list of Python libraries required to execute the script.

## Examples of Use
Detailed examples of use and description of each
script can be found in the examples folder on GitLab/Github.
